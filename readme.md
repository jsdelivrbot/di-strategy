## Motivation
Implement [Composition Root](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/07/28/CompositionRoot/) and [IoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) design patterns, helping developers to keep all things decoupled and wire application components and config at one root place.

Allowing developers to write good [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) Object Oriented (OO) design
and encouraging [Composite Reuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance).
